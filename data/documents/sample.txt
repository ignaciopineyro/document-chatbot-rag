Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, 
and natural language processing. It aims to create intelligent systems that can perform 
tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from 
experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to give 
computers the ability to "learn" from data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that focuses on the 
interaction between computers and human language. It involves developing algorithms and 
models that can understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been 
particularly successful in areas like image recognition and language processing.
